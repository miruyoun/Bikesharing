Given the success of the bike-sharing program in NYC, this analysis is intended to help investors decide whether expanding the program to Des Moines, Illinois would be a viable and profitable business.

## Results

### Checkout Times for Users

In the image above, we can see that bike trip duration usually lasts up to five minutes. After five minutes, bike utilization decreases exponentially, and after an hour, it plateaus. 

### Checkout Times by Gender

In the image above, it depicts a similar graph from the previous image but split by gender. At peak trip duration times, there is a difference of nearly 75 thousand rides between men and women using bikes.

### Trips by Weekday per Hour

The heatmap above shows the number of rides during the hour of the day vs. weekday. Darker colors indicate more bike use, and peak bike activity is around 8 a.m. and 5-6 p.m.

### Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)

According to the heatmap above, peak bike activity occurs between 8 am and 6 pm, but males use bikes more than females.

### Trips by Weekday per Hour Continued

This map is a continuation of the Trips by Gender heatmap and this shows the other half of the male portion and unknown users.

### User Trips by Gender by Weekday

The last heatmap shows bike usage by user type (regulars vs subscribers). We can see that most of the bike usage comes from male and female subscribers.

### Average Trip Duration by Birth Year

According to this graph, young people tend to use the bike for longer periods of time. In the elderly, there is little consistency, and some age groups don't ride bikes very much.

### August Peak Hours

In this graph, it shows that biking was most popular during the daytime hours. There is a peak during the hours of 4-7 pm and a smaller peak during the hours of 8-9 am. 

## Summary
Based off the analysis, I believe that expanding the bike-sharing program in Des Moines would be a great decision. In large metropolitan areas such as New York City, public transportation is a necessity for many people. The bike-sharing program would allow for fast and accesible mode of transportation which would also benefit in a metropolitan area as Des Moines. One thing to note is that majority of the riders were male so promoting to females could bring in more profit. Finally, two additional visualizations needed for future analysis would be...
  * Average trip duration and/or number of rides chart seperated by gender.
  * Heatmap showing density of starting and ending locations of bikes during rush hours.
